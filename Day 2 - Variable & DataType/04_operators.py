# Arithmetic Operators

a = 5

print(c)

# Assignment Operators

a = 15 - 10 
print (a) # a will result as 5

b = 20
b += 2 # Increment of 2 will happen in b variable b result will be 22
print(b)

d = 40

# Comparison Operator (> , <, ==, != , => , =<) They always return boolean value

number = 5 > 5
print(number) # this will return False, as statement is incorrect

num = 5 < 10 
print (num) # this will return True, as statement is correct


# Logical Operators

# Truth table of AND operate
print("True and Ture is", True and True)
print("True and False is", True and False)
print("False and Ture is", False and True)

# Truth table of OR operate
print("True and Ture is", True or True)
print("True and False is", True or False)
print("False and Ture is", False or True)

# NOT operator make false into true and true into false
print(not(False))
