# Arithmetic Operators

a = 5
b = 18

c = a + b # after adding a and b ans will be 23

print(c)

# Assignment Operators

a = 15 - 10 
print (a) # a will result as 5

b = 20
b += 2 # Increment of 2 will happen in b variable b result will be 22
print(b)

c = 35
c -= 34 # Decrement of 34 will happen and c result will be 1
print(c)

d = 40
d //= 10 #This will divide the number and will give you answer to nearst round
print(d)

# Comparison Operator (> , <, ==, != , => , =<) They always return boolean value

number = 5 > 5
print(number) # this will return False, as statement is incorrect

num = 5 < 10 
print (num) # this will return True, as statement is correct
